This Breakout remake was made in javascript and HTML5 as homework for the subject of Web Development II.

## The game

It is like the original arcade, the player controls a bar that bounces the ball so that it breaks the blocks. When all the blocks are destroyed, the game finish and player wins. If the ball fall down 5 times (player's lifes) the game finish and player loses.

## About the project

This game was developed with pure javascript and the HTML5 Canvas as an technical schoolwork. 
It was simple to make the game, it has few and simple features, but it was still fun. We got the sounds from a public database and without DMCA.

### Project finished and closed

The game has simple features and has nothing we would like to add, is just a simple homework, so it is finished! If you want to contribute or use the code as an example, just clone it and do whatever you want.
